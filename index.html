<h1>COMMUNICATION CHANNEL FAILURE PREDICTION IN 5G
CELLULAR NETWORKS</h1>
<h2>Author: Mohammad Ariful Islam</h2>
<h2>Supervisor: Dr. Israat Haque</h2>

<p>Network communications and the Internet shapes our daily activities our daily lives.
The 5 GHz radio frequency is the latest addition to the favour of the technology.
The 5 GHz link are prone to weather and spatial properties. Natural disasters have
potentially huge impact on modern ultra speed 5Ghz radio connections and most of
the sensitive operations requires ultra fast communication system which are backed
up by the 5 Ghz radio technologies. The radio link failure event occurs due to the
spatial and the weather effect on the links. Prediction of such link failure will save
the inconvenience and reduce the waste of the financial resources in the high speed
radio communication. In this study, we propose an time series based neural network
that can learn from historical weather, forecast weather and historical radio link key
performance indicators to forecast radio link failure events five days into the future
in mobile-backhaul links. Backhaul links will play an important role in establishing
5G telecommunications era and these links are affected by weather conditions. Our
proposed approach predict the radio link failure one day ahead by considering rain
and wind related the weather events. Also, We compared our approach with existing
state-of-art solution in this work. A regional weather forecast data along with the
radio tower key performance indicator( KPI) feature data are available which lists
expected conditions of the weather data as well as the key features of radio tower
sensor respectively. Several steps were taken for processing the weather and the sensor
KPI data before training our selected learning model. In this research, we calculated
the failure prediction by utilizing the deep learning properties and highlighted the
improvements of results in our solution over the existing state-of-the-art solution</p>
